# Reinforcement learning for 2-D navigation using Keras-RL

This is a project aimed at building a Deep Q-learning agent for navigating through procedurally-generated worlds.
The game environment is built on the Open-AI Gym framework.
Since the boundaries, "enemies", and goals are randomized, each episode of gameplay is entirely unique,
requiring that the agent learn to explore and move towards its goal while recognizing enemy threats as they appear.

### Example
Agent trained to reach a goal while avoiding static enemies.
